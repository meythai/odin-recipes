    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>170g protein, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp cooking oil</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>5 stalks Chinese broccoli</li>
        <li>1 lb fresh wide rice noodles</li>
        <li> 4 tsp granulated sugar</li>
        <li>ground white pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>Optional condiment: chili vinegar</li>
        <h4>Sauce</h4>
        <li> 3 Tbsp oyster sauce</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp fish sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp Golden Mountain sauce</li>
        <li>2 tsp dark soy sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>Mix together the meat and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of soy sauce, then add about 2 teaspoon (10 ml) of oil and stir to coat the meat; the oil will help the meat separate more easily in the pan. </ol>
    <ol>Separate the noodles into individual portion - 8 oz (225 g) per portion.</ol>
    <ol>Combine all sauce ingredients together and stir to mix well, divide the sauce evenly into individual portions - each portion is 2 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon (35 ml)</ol>
    <ol>Heat 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of the oil in a wok or a large non-stick sauté pan over high heat. When hot, add all of the protein and toss just until fully cooked. Remove from the pan and set aside. </ol>
    <ol>From this step onward, I recommend cooking 1 portion at a time for best result: Add 1½ tablespoon (22 ml) oil and the garlic to the wok and sauté over medium high heat until the smallest bits of garlic starts to turn colour.</ol>
    <ol>Add the egg, break the yolk, let it set just about halfway, then scramble briefly.</ol>
    <ol>Add the Chinese broccoli and toss to coat it in the oil, about 10–15 seconds.</ol>
    <ol>Add 1 portion of rice noodles, 1 portion of the sauce mixture, and 2 teaspoon of sugar. Turn the heat up to high and toss to coat the noodles evenly in the sauce. To prevent noodles from breaking, push the noodles </ol>
    <ol>Once coated, spread the noodles out to cover the entire pan and let them sit without stirring for about 15-30 seconds until some of the noodles have charred. Flip or toss the noodles and let them sit again to char the other side. You may flip the noodles again a couple more times to get more toasting if you wish. </ol>
    <ol>Add 1 portion of the cooked protein back into the pan without adding any meat juices that has accumulated, and toss briefly to mix. Turn off the heat.</ol>
    <ol>Plate the noodles, then quickly wipe the pan clean with paper towel and cook the next serving.</ol>
    <ol>Serve with chili vinegar, and enjoy!</ol>
