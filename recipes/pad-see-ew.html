    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>170g protein of your choice, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp soy sauce for marinating meat, , omit if using shrimp or tofu </li>
        <li>3-4 Tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>4-6 stalks Chinese broccoli, stems thinly sliced, leaves roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1 lb fresh wide rice noodles</li>
        <li> 4 tsp granulated sugar</li>
        <li>Ground white pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>Optional condiment: chili vinegar</li>
        <h4>Sauce</h4>
        <li>2 Tbsp oyster sauce</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp fish sauce</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp Golden Mountain sauce</li>
        <li>2 tsp Thai black soy sauce or dark soy sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix together the meat and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of soy sauce, then add about 2 teaspoon (10 ml) of oil and stir to coat the meat; the oil will help the meat separate more easily in the pan.</li>
    <li>Separate the noodles into individual portion - 8 oz (225 g) per portion.</li>
    <li>Combine all sauce ingredients together and stir to mix well, divide the sauce evenly into individual portions - each portion is 2 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon (35 ml)</li>
    <li>Heat 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of the oil in a wok or a large non-stick sauté pan over high heat. When hot, add all of the protein and toss just until fully cooked. Remove from the pan and set aside. </li>
    <li>From this step onward, I recommend cooking 1 portion at a time for best result: Add 1½ tablespoon (22 ml) oil and the garlic to the wok and sauté over medium high heat until the smallest bits of garlic starts to turn colour.</li>
    <li>Add the egg, break the yolk, let it set just about halfway, then scramble briefly.</li>
    <li>Add the Chinese broccoli and toss to coat it in the oil, about 10–15 seconds.</li>
    <li>Add 1 portion of rice noodles, 1 portion of the sauce mixture, and 2 teaspoon of sugar. Turn the heat up to high and toss to coat the noodles evenly in the sauce. To prevent noodles from breaking, push the noodles</li>
    <li>Once coated, spread the noodles out to cover the entire pan and let them sit without stirring for about 15-30 seconds until some of the noodles have charred. Flip or toss the noodles and let them sit again to char the other side. You may flip the noodles again a couple more times to get more toasting if you wish.</li>
    <li>Add 1 portion of the cooked protein back into the pan without adding any meat juices that has accumulated, and toss briefly to mix. Turn off the heat.</li>
    <li>Plate the noodles, then quickly wipe the pan clean with paper towel and cook the next serving.</li>
    <li>Serve with chili vinegar, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
